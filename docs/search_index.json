Murrah 2021-08-17 Introduction to the Course Welcome! This is a notebook for ERMA 8350 Advanced Measurement Theory. The class will be using the textbook Modern Psychometrics with R (Mair 2018), which will be the primary source for the course. I will use this notebook to make available additional information to help you learn the material. It may include some examples from the textbook, with some elaborations, additional readings, and some more details about implementing the methods in R. These web-based notes will make it easy for you to use code, by allowing you to copy and paste code found within. Some of you will have experience with R and others not. So I will try to also point you to additional resources that may be helpful. For example, in this preface I will provide links to resources to help you setup R and RStudio. RStudio is a platform to make using R more productive. I will use it extensively in this course. Software There are at least two way you can access the software needed for this course. You can use the virtual labs on campus. I know at least the education virtual labls have R and RStudio installed. IF you go this route you can watch the following video. Note you will need Duo setup for this to work. Using Vlab to acces R/RStudio A better option if you have a laptop, you can install both programs on your computer. They are both absolutely free and available on all major operating systems, so you will not have to worry about transferring information across computers, limited connection speeds, or other hassles inherent with the Vlab route. The following links take you to videos instructing you how to install them. Installing R and RStudio Organizing Projects in RStudio Resources for Learning R While such experience is certainly helpful, I do not assume you have prior knowledge of using R. I will demonstrate the use of R and provide (particularly in this notebook) the R code needed to use the methods we will learn. However, even if you have prior experience with R, you should plan to spend time learning to program in R. Some people find this intimidating initially, but most of you will grow to find R programming rewarding, and even fun by the end of the course. But, there will be frustration for sure. Here are some good places to start learning R: CRAN R Packages R is, among other paradigms, a functional programming language, which means is heavily utilizes functions. R’s functions are stored in packages. While base R has a long list of very useful functions, to fully realize the power of R you will have to use additional packages. So, learning how to install packages (downloading from the web to your computer) and loading packages (making the package’s functions accessible to your current R session) are important skills to master.

I use Tau here instead of T, because T is a protected symbol in R which is short-hand for TRUE. Note that we would not know Tau in most situations, but because this is simulated data we will pretend we do. We can create a composite score for the ten items for each individual on each occasion by averaging columns 3 through 12. CTTdata$X &lt;- rowMeans(CTTdata[ ,3:12]) And we can also create E, the error with: CTTdata$E &lt;- CTTdata$X - CTTdata$Tau Again, in practice we would not be able to directly compute E because we would not know Tau, but we will use it to build an understanding of what error is. Now we have: CTTdata id time x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 x8 x9 x10 Tau X E 1 1 1 3 6 5 3 5 5 4 5 3 3 4 4.2 0.2 2 1 2 6 3 5 3 4 2 4 4 3 5 4 3.9 -0.1 3 1 3 4 4 2 4 4 3 5 3 4 5 4 3.8 -0.2 4 2 1 3 6 8 6 5 4 5 5 5 5 5 5.2 0.2 5 2 2 6 4 6 6 4 6 6 5 4 4 5 5.1 0.1 6 2 3 4 6 6 5 5 5 1 3 6 4 5 4.5 -0.5 7 3 1 6 5 6 6 6 6 9 6 6 5 6 6.1 0.1 8 3 2 6 6 6 7 5 6 6 6 6 7 6 6.1 0.1 9 3 3 6 5 8 6 6 6 7 7 5 7 6 6.3 0.3 10 4 1 4 3 5 4 2 3 3 5 5 2 4 3.6 -0.4 11 4 2 4 5 5 4 5 5 3 5 3 4 4 4.3 0.3 12 4 3 2 4 4 4 6 4 3 4 5 4 4 4.0 0.0 13 5 1 5 6 5 4 5 5 5 6 5 6 5 5.2 0.2 14 5 2 6 6 4 6 4 5 4 5 5 5 5 5.0 0.0 15 5 3 6 4 5 4 5 5 4 4 5 5 5 4.7 -0.3 16 6 1 6 6 7 8 6 6 7 6 6 4 6 6.2 0.2 17 6 2 4 5 7 5 5 7 4 5 6 7 6 5.5 -0.5 18 6 3 5 6 6 6 4 5 4 5 7 6 6 5.4 -0.6 Look over the last three columns and make sure you understand their relation.

This tutorial is based on Chapter 1 of Mair (2018), which can be consulted for a more in depth exposition of the underlying theory. Here I focus on demonstrating some of those concepts in R, as well as describing how to get certain results in R. First, I load the packages used in this tutorial: # Packages used: library(psych) library(MPsychoR) Next, I load the full data set from the MPsychoR package (Mair 2020), then as in the chapter, I subset the data to only include hybrid motivation items, followed by removing rows with missing values. data(&quot;Rmotivation&quot;) # Create data frame with only Hybrid Motivation items. HybMot &lt;- subset(Rmotivation, select = grep(&quot;hyb&quot;, names(Rmotivation))) # Remove rows with any missing data. HybMot &lt;- na.omit(HybMot) This leads to a data set with 777 authors and 19 items. # How many authors(rows) and items(columns)? dim(HybMot) [1] 777 19 # Note they are all dichotomous items. head(HybMot) hyb1 hyb2 hyb3 hyb4 hyb5 hyb6 hyb7 hyb8 hyb9 hyb10 hyb11 hyb12 hyb13 hyb14 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 3 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 4 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 5 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 9 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 hyb15 hyb16 hyb17 hyb18 hyb19 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 1 0 0 1 0 4 0 1 1 1 1 5 1 0 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 9 0 1 1 1 1 # Variance/Covariance Matrix vcmat &lt;- cov(HybMot) scroll_box(kable(vcmat, digits = 2), width = &quot;100%&quot;) hyb1 hyb2 hyb3 hyb4 hyb5 hyb6 hyb7 hyb8 hyb9 hyb10 hyb11 hyb12 hyb13 hyb14 hyb15 hyb16 hyb17 hyb18 hyb19 hyb1 0.18 0.06 0.04 0.03 0.03 0.05 0.01 0.05 0.04 0.04 0.03 0.03 0.03 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.06 hyb2 0.06 0.25 0.06 0.05 0.03 0.05 -0.01 0.04 0.05 0.02 0.04 0.04 0.03 0.03 0.03 0.03 0.01 0.00 0.03 hyb3 0.04 0.06 0.23 0.13 0.03 0.05 0.00 0.03 0.05 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.02 0.02 0.06 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.04 hyb4 0.03 0.05 0.13 0.21 0.03 0.04 0.01 0.03 0.04 0.03 0.05 0.05 0.02 0.02 0.04 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.04 hyb5 0.03 0.03 0.03 0.03 0.11 0.02 0.00 0.01 0.01 0.03 0.03 0.03 0.03 0.02 0.04 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.03 hyb6 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.04 0.02 0.24 0.01 0.11 0.15 0.05 0.06 0.06 0.02 0.07 0.06 0.05 0.05 0.02 0.07 hyb7 0.01 -0.01 0.00 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.22 0.04 0.01 0.03 0.00 0.02 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.02 hyb8 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.03 0.01 0.11 0.04 0.25 0.10 0.06 0.05 0.06 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.05 0.05 0.03 0.06 hyb9 0.04 0.05 0.05 0.04 0.01 0.15 0.01 0.10 0.20 0.04 0.04 0.05 0.01 0.05 0.04 0.04 0.03 0.01 0.05 hyb10 0.04 0.02 0.04 0.03 0.03 0.05 0.03 0.06 0.04 0.15 0.03 0.06 0.03 0.02 0.04 0.04 0.04 0.03 0.05 hyb11 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.05 0.03 0.06 0.00 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.23 0.10 0.03 0.04 0.10 0.03 0.03 0.01 0.02 hyb12 0.03 0.04 0.06 0.05 0.03 0.06 0.02 0.06 0.05 0.06 0.10 0.23 0.04 0.03 0.11 0.04 0.03 0.02 0.04 hyb13 0.03 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.02 0.00 0.02 0.01 0.03 0.03 0.04 0.10 0.01 0.03 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.02 hyb14 0.03 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.07 0.00 0.04 0.05 0.02 0.04 0.03 0.01 0.20 0.03 0.04 0.03 0.01 0.04 hyb15 0.04 0.03 0.06 0.04 0.04 0.06 0.01 0.06 0.04 0.04 0.10 0.11 0.03 0.03 0.23 0.03 0.03 0.02 0.04 hyb16 0.05 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.05 0.02 0.05 0.04 0.04 0.03 0.04 0.03 0.04 0.03 0.17 0.06 0.05 0.07 hyb17 0.04 0.01 0.03 0.03 0.02 0.05 0.02 0.05 0.03 0.04 0.03 0.03 0.02 0.03 0.03 0.06 0.14 0.04 0.07 hyb18 0.03 0.00 0.02 0.02 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.03 0.01 0.03 0.01 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.05 0.04 0.08 0.05 hyb19 0.06 0.03 0.04 0.04 0.03 0.07 0.02 0.06 0.05 0.05 0.02 0.04 0.02 0.04 0.04 0.07 0.07 0.05 0.21 k &lt;- ncol(HybMot) sigma2_Xi &lt;- tr(vcmat) # trace of matrix or sum(diag(vmat)) sigma2_X &lt;- sum(vcmat) 1.2.2 Other Reliability Coefficients 1.3 Generalizability Theory Generalizability theory, or G-theory for short, is an extension of CTT, which decomposes the one error term in CTT into multiple sources of error called facets. These could include sources such as items, raters, or measurement occasions. These were each given a subscript on page 2 of the text. Before looking at these different sources of error, let’s calculate Cronbach’s \\(\\alpha\\) in a different way, that will allow this decomposition going forward. We will first need to reshape the data from wide to long format. A great tutorial on reshaping data with the reshape2 package can be found here: https://seananderson.ca/2013/10/19/reshape/ Basically, we need to transform the data so that instead of each item being in a separate column are reshaped so there is one column with the cell values, and one column that identifies which item the score is from. library(&quot;reshape2&quot;) # Add person variable Hyb1 &lt;- data.frame(HybMot, person = 1:nrow(HybMot)) Hyblong &lt;- melt(Hyb1, id.vars = c(&quot;person&quot;), variable.name = &quot;item&quot;) Hyblong$person &lt;- as.factor(Hyblong$person) 1.3.1 Reliability and Generalizability summary(aov(value ~ person + item, data = Hyblong)) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) person 776 663.0 0.85 5.549 &lt;2e-16 *** item 18 573.8 31.88 207.048 &lt;2e-16 *** Residuals 13968 2150.5 0.15 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 From this output we can calculate Cronbach’s \\(\\alpha\\) with the following values: MSp &lt;- 0.85 MSe &lt;- 0.15 alpha &lt;- (MSp - MSe)/MSp print(alpha, digits = 2) [1] 0.82 ICC(HybMot) Call: ICC(x = HybMot) Intraclass correlation coefficients type ICC F df1 df2 p lower bound Single_raters_absolute ICC1 0.15 4.4 776 13986 7.2e-279 0.14 Single_random_raters ICC2 0.16 5.5 776 13968 0.0e+00 0.14 Single_fixed_raters ICC3 0.19 5.5 776 13968 0.0e+00 0.18 Average_raters_absolute ICC1k 0.77 4.4 776 13986 7.2e-279 0.75 Average_random_raters ICC2k 0.78 5.5 776 13968 0.0e+00 0.75 Average_fixed_raters ICC3k 0.82 5.5 776 13968 0.0e+00 0.80 upper bound Single_raters_absolute 0.17 Single_random_raters 0.18 Single_fixed_raters 0.21 Average_raters_absolute 0.79 Average_random_raters 0.81 Average_fixed_raters 0.83 Number of subjects = 777 Number of Judges = 19 icchyb &lt;- ICC(HybMot) sqrt((0.85-0.15)/19) [1] 0.191943 sqrt((31.88-0.15)/777) [1] 0.2020806 library(&quot;lme4&quot;) Loading required package: Matrix VarCorr(lmer(value ~ (1|person) + (1|item), data = Hyblong)) Groups Name Std.Dev. person (Intercept) 0.19200 item (Intercept) 0.20206 Residual 0.39238 library(&quot;gtheory&quot;) gfit &lt;- gstudy(data = Hyblong, formula = value ~ (1|person) + (1|item)) dfit &lt;- dstudy(gfit, colname.objects = &quot;person&quot;, colname.scores = &quot;value&quot;, data = Hyblong) round(dfit$generalizability, 3) [1] 0.82 1.3.2 Multiple Sources of Error Generalizability theory acknowledges that multiple sources of error can impact scores simultaneously, and allow for estimating the effects of each (Raykov and Marcoulides 2011). These various sources of error, or facets (e.g., items, raters, measurement occasions). All measurements of behavior are conceptualized as being sampled from a universe of admissible observations (Raykov and Marcoulides 2011). If the observed score is expected to vary across a facet (e.g. vary across occasions, or vary depending on the items included, or the rater scoring), then that facet is a defining characteristic of the universe. The idea of reliability is replace with the idea of generalizability, which ,instead of asking how accurately observed scores can reflect the true score (CTT), generalizability theory asks how accurately observed scores allow us to generalize about behavior of an individual in a particular universe.

Often, subsets of these variables are measuring the same, or very similar things. We might like to reduce the variables to a smaller number of predictors. What if you are developing a measurement scale and have a large number of items you think measure the same construct You might want to see how strongly the items are related to the construct. 2.2 Solutions Principal Components Analysis transforming the original variables into a new set of linear combinations (pricipal components). Factor Analysis setting up a mathematical model to estimate the number or factors 2.3 Principal Components Analysis Concerned with explaining variance-covariance structure of a set of variables. PCA attempts to explain as much of the total variance among the observed variables as possible with a smaller number of components. Because the variables are standardized prior to analysis, the total amount of variance available is the number of variables. The goal is data reduction for subsequent analysis. Variables cause components. Components are not representative of any underlying theory. 2.4 Factor Analysis The goal is understanding underlying constructs. Uses a modified correlation matrix (reduced matrix) factors cause the variables. Factors represent theoretical constructs. Focuses on the common variance of the variables, and purges the unique variance. 2.5 Components The principal components partition the total variance (the sum of the variances of the original variables) by finding the linear combination of the variables that account for the maximum amount of variance: \\[ PC1 = a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 ... a_{1p}x_p, \\] This is repeated as many time as there are variables. 2.6 PC Extraction draw pretty pictures on the board 2.7 Eigenvalues Eigenvalues represent the variance in the variables explained by the success components. 2.8 Determining the Number of Factors Kaiser criterion: Retain only factors with eigenvalues &gt; 1. (generally accurate) Scree plot: plot eigenvalues and drop factors after leveling off. Parallel analysis: compare observed eigenvalues to parallel set of data from randomly generated data. Retain factors in original if eigenvalue is greater than random eigenvalue. Factor meaningfulness is also very important to consider. 2.9 Example data d1 d2 d3 d4 d1 1.00 0.70 0.65 0.62 d2 0.70 1.00 0.66 0.63 d3 0.65 0.66 1.00 0.60 d4 0.62 0.63 0.60 1.00 2.10 Kaiser Retain factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 [1] 2.9311792 0.4103921 0.3592372 0.2991916 2.11 Scree Plot 2.12 Horn’s Parallel Analysis Parallel analysis suggests that the number of factors = NA and the number of components = 1 2.13 Another example Parallel analysis suggests that the number of factors = NA and the number of components = 2 2.14 Rotation Principal components are derived to maximize the variance accounted for (data reduction). Rotation is done to make the factors more interpretable (i.e. meaningful). Two major classes of rotation: Orthogonal - new factors are still uncorrelated, as were the initial factors. Oblique - new factors are allowed to be correlated. Essentially reallocates the loadings. The first factor may not be the one accounting for the most variance. 2.15 Orthogonal Rotation Quartimax - idea is to clean up the variables. Rotation done so each variable loads mainly on one factor. Problematic if there is a general factor on which most or all variables load on (think IQ). Varimax - to clean up factors. So each factor has high correlation with a smaller number of variables, low correlation with the other variables. Generally makes interpretation easier. 2.16 Oblique Rotation Often correlated factors are more reasonable. Therefore, oblique rotation is often preferred. But interpretation is more complicated. 2.17 Factor Matrices Factor pattern matrix: includes pattern coefficients analogous to standardized partial regression coefficients. Indicated the unique importance of a factor to a variable, holding other factors constant. Factor structure matrix: includes structure coefficients which are simple correlations of the variables with the factors. 2.18 Which matrix should we interpret? When orthogonal rotation is used interpret structural coefficients (but they are the same as pattern coefficients). When oblique rotation is used pattern coefficients are preferred because they account for the correlation between the factors and they are parameters of the correlated factor model (which we will discuss next class). 2.19 Which variables should be used to interpret each factor? The idea is to use only those variables that have a strong association with the factor. Typical thresholds are |.30| or |.40|. Content knowledge is critical. 2.20 Examples Let’s look at some examples 2.21 Steps in Factor Analysis Choose extraction method So far we’ve focused on PCA Determine the number of components/factors Kaiser method: eigenvalues &gt; 1 Scree plot: All components before leveling off Horn’s parallel analysis: components/factors greater than simulated values from random numbers Rotate Factors Orthogonal Oblique Interpret Components/Factors 2.22 Tom Swift’s Eletric Factor Analysis Factory “Little Jiffy” method of factor analysis Extraction method : PCA Number of factors: eigenvalues &gt; 1 Rotation: orthogonal(varimax) Interpretation 2.23 Metal Boxes 2.24 Correlations 2.25 Eigenvalues &gt; 1 2.26 Orthogonal Rotation Loadings: RC1 RC3 RC2 thick 0.212 0.947 -0.053 width 0.801 0.382 -0.011 length 0.936 -0.006 0.054 volume 0.634 0.744 -0.122 density -0.102 -0.060 0.930 weight 0.440 0.610 0.509 surface 0.792 0.600 -0.078 crosssec 0.942 0.287 -0.031 edge 0.892 0.422 -0.031 diagonal 0.905 0.327 -0.088 cost -0.023 -0.012 0.841 RC1 RC3 RC2 SS loadings 5.298 2.699 1.868 Proportion Var 0.482 0.245 0.170 Cumulative Var 0.482 0.727 0.897 2.27 Orthogonal Rotation with Loadings &gt; .70 Loadings: RC1 RC3 RC2 thick 0.947 width 0.801 length 0.936 volume 0.744 density 0.930 weight surface 0.792 crosssec 0.942 edge 0.892 diagonal 0.905 cost 0.841 RC1 RC3 RC2 SS loadings 5.298 2.699 1.868 Proportion Var 0.482 0.245 0.170 Cumulative Var 0.482 0.727 0.897 "],["path-analysis-and-structural-equation-modeling.html", "Chapter 3 Path Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling", " Chapter 3 Path Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling We describe our methods in this chapter.
