# Introduction to R Programming

Before we can start learning about advanced measurement theory, we need a basic understanding of the software we will use.

To understand why I use R, learn how to install it, and for an introduction to its use, go to <https://www.statistical-thinking.com> and follow the link in the left-hand column called "Introduction to R and RStudio" under the "Statistical Software" section.
Read through the materials and watch the linked videos.

## Under Contruction
Many sections on the website referenced above are in draft form. 
:::

When you have worked through that section of the website read through chapter 1 of the textbook "Introduction to the R Programming Language". 
Make sure you try many of the coding examples within these resources. 
Don't worry if you are having trouble with some tasks. 
The important thing is to come to the next class with good questions.
